{title: "What are Honey Bees?", text: "Short answer, an insect. But in fact, Honey Bees or Apis Mellifera are truly wonderful little creatures and close (but friendlier) relatives of wasps and ants. They are found on every continent on earth, except for Antarctica (Brrrrrr). Honeybees live in “colonies” that can number in excess of 80,000 and are quite social-meaning one generation helps raise successive generations!"},
{title: "What do Bees do?", text: "Honey Bees forage for nectar and pollen from flowering plants.  They use the nectar they collect  to create our sweet treat, and one of their primary resources - honey!  Bees then process or break down the complex sucrose of the nectar into two simple sugars, fructose and glucose. Once converted it is neatly packed into a honeycomb cell.  Almost complete; the bees will then beat their wings furiously over top of this syrupy sweet liquid to fan out the moisture or dehydrate to the proper levels to thicken the substance. When it is complete, the bees will cap that cell with beeswax, sealing the perfected honey for consumption."},
{title: "What is Wrong?", text: "Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is the phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear; the bees are gone. . . There is plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees and that’s it. There have been many theories about the cause of CCD, but the researchers and bee keepers alike, globally are trying to find out why are now focused on these factors:<br><br><li> Increased losses due to the invasive varroa mite (a pest of honey bees).<br><li> Pesticide poisoning through exposure to pesticides applied to crops</li><li> Stress bees experience due to management practices such as transportation to multiple locations across the country for providing pollination services.</li><li> Changes to the habitat where bees forage. Ie Monoculture</li><li> Inadequate forage/poor nutrition.</li><li> Potential immune-suppressing stress on bees caused by one or a combination of factors identified above.</li>"},
{title: "How Bee Guardianship Helps", text: "Bee Guardianship is a \"Bee First\" approach to beekeeping.<br><br>I started with the saying: “Its not about the honey, honey, it’s about the Bees.\" Bee guardianship starts and ends with you.  It is using natural methods of pest control when prudent, ie using mint, cinnamon, grasses, lavender & other essential oils, focusing on healthy bees and hives not honey production.<br><br>Bee Guardian is also the name we have adapted to one of our hive rental or management programs.  See “Rookie Bee” and “Bee Guardian” for more information"},
{title: "How you can Help", text: "Plant high nectar and pollen producing plants and trees. Embrace the dandelion (it’s the first source of significant nectar of the season for many bees).  Get involved, eat honey and hive products, meet a local beekeeper, volunteer at an Apiary, join a club, or buy a hive and support the Urban Bee Keeping Movement!"}
