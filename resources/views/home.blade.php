        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to promote sustainable “bee first” beekeeping through education, experience-based research and an Urban Apiary Project to help promote the health and vitality of the honeybee. Heff’s Hives and Honey was started simply with starting to learn a little bit about; and to help do something positive for honeybees. I realized very quickly that the honeybees are so much more than pollinators or honey producers.   They are an integral part of the vast, complex living organism, Earth and vital.  Now my goal is to inspire, not only interest, joy and love for, but also a new understanding and awareness for the importance of these terrifically resourceful &amp; vulnerable creatures. Heff’s Hives provides Queens, Nuc’s &amp; a complete line of beekeeping equipment &amp; necessities to support new and seasoned beekeepers alike.</p>

        <h3>The Bees</h3>
        <p>The honey and beeswax gathered were used for many purposes. Today, many advances have been made in this aspect of agriculture. Some people derive their income from their apiaries while many others keep honeybees as a hobby. Only female honey bees can sting, the males (drones) are not able to, whereas, Queen honey bees can sting, but they remain close to the hive, and so a sting form a honey bee queen would be very rare.  If the queen honey bee is removed from the hive, within 15 minutes, the rest of the colony knows about it!  A typical honey bee colony may have around 50,000 workers.</p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Dan.  I have always liked nature and as an avid outdoors person I had been aware of the issues facing the Bees and moreover all pollinators, but I wasn't doing anything about it. One day my daughter came to me and stated, "Dad you must do something to help the bees." This is my effort...it started with two hives and quickly grew to living with sometiemes in excess of two million bees right in my back yard. 
		The last few years I have immersed myself into everything “bee” and found out all kinds about the bees, nature and myself along the way... What I have learned here and the problems I have encountered along the way have led to – Heffs Hives-A full service honey house, beekeeping equipment supply and one of the most fun aspects.... local contract beekeeping.</p>
