        	<h3>OUR SERVICES</h3>
        	<p>During my first couple of years around the bees I found the hard way to do most things despite research and my best efforts.  Bees sting, equipment costs money and honey is sticky..... I quickly realized many people were facing the same issues and very well a barriers to entry to help or to get more involved.The services we provide allow individuals at any level of interest or participation to take a moderate, or “at their pace” approach to beekeeping. For the beginner &amp; Intermediate alike we offer:
			<br>•    Bee courses and tutorials in a class room setting, our apiaries or your yard.
			<br>•    Hive rentals or purchases w support programs (“Rookie-Bee”, “The Worker Bee”)
			<br>•    Pest management support &amp; consulting
			<br>•    Honey harvest (Custom bottling &amp; honey extraction).
